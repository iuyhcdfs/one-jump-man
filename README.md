made with love for the NSI winter game jam, australia, sydney, 2018

solo project. under construction.

your ability to run and jump can be trained, and naturally decays.

if you mash up/down and spacebar, you'll exercise your running/jumping power.
you can't exercise your turning ability.

On the ground:
Spacebar: Jump!
Up/Down Arrow Keys: move forwards/backwards
Left/Right Arrow Keys: look to the left/right

In the air: 
Left/Right Arrow Keys: you can curve your midair flight very comfortably.

uhh, you look like a cube. lets say you're a block of tofu; shoutouts to splatoon
