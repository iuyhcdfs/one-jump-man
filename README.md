# One Jump Man

solo project made with love for the NSI winter game jam, australia, sydney, 2018

the theme was "montage". the interpretation taken was the type of montage you'd see in Rocky (movie).

the Rocky montage lets the audience see an increase in the main character's strength in a short period of time.

## What happens in the game?

It's a platformer where you quickly exercise to become physically able to clear levels.

If you hold down run buttons, your ground acceleration permanently improves.
If you mash the jump button, your jumping height permanently improves.

With this, theres always 2 or 3 ways to clear each level.

Get to the green goal to clear the first 3 levels. The last one is a sandbox.

Ahem, i may have bent the truth. If you go into a new level, your acceleration stats are reset.

## Controls 

There should still be debug text that displays this as you play. Convenience!
